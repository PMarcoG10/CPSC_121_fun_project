# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
For this milestone we has to change up our code so it can handle pointers. Especially unique pointers. The only files that had major changes was the game file. Since that file took care of everything. 

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
The challenges I came across were pointers. Since I don't have a good grasp on them. I had a hard time trying to figure out how they work but more or less just how to implement them into my code. 

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
The most important thing I learned in this milestone were unique pointers. Since they require more focus. In other words we had to use them correctly or else we would get giant errors.
