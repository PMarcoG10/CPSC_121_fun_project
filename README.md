# fun_project
This was a semster project for CPSC 121. In this Project we had to make a remake of the popular game Asteroids.

#Learning objectives
1. Implement a complex programming project with multiple components.
2. Refactor and refine code created from a previous milestone to solve newly introduced challenges in the next milestone.
3. Design and implement software that makes appropriate use of fundamental programming constructs and data structures (e.g., expressions, conditions, loops, functions, primitive data types, vectors).
4. Design and implement software that makes appropriate use of object-oriented concepts (e.g., classes, objects, methods, composition, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, polymorphism).
5. Design and implement software that makes appropriate use of advanced programming concepts (e.g., pass by reference, pointers, recursion, breadth-first search, STL).
6. Write code that  uses proper encapsulation and decoupling.
7. Write code that uses industry coding standards.
8. Write appropriate inline comments to help other developers understand and reuse code.
9. Analyze and interpret compilation errors, unit test results, and code behavior to debug code.
